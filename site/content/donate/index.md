If you would like to help keep the lights on for IsMetroBurning, you can find a link at the bottom of this page. But, keep the following in mind.

When you make a donation using the provided link, you are not giving us your money. Your money goes to the service provider we use for web hosting/computation. That money is then issued to us  as a credit.

That credit is used to pay for our hosting costs. Which included hosting fees/storage fees for the website, and computation time for fetching and processing WMATA incident data. By donating, you are effectively paying our bill, for us.

At no point, can we withdraw the money for any purposes. It can only be used to fund our production, and testing servers.

With that in mind, if you like to make a donation, you can do so [here](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/contribute/ismetroburning.com).
